# Bake My Eye

Its true! For developers the home is a dark themed code editor and the playground is a bright white browser window. 
This bakes every developers eyes. The pretty pupils are always under a recursive expansion and contraction which is extremely harmful. 

To circumvent this problem, developers generally reduce the brightness low which is suitable for broser but this makes the code editor appear so faint that the pretty pupils have to expand. And expand so large that it hurts. 

Bake My Eye is a simple attempt at solving this problem. The app will update screen brightness when you switch from Code Editor to Browser and vice-a-versa.

Currently, its only a terminal application with hard-coded values for Terminal and Google Chrome for testing purposes. The real desktop app shall arrive really soon.
