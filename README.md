# Bake My Eye

Its true! For developers the home is a dark themed code editor and the playground is a bright white browser window. 
This bakes every developers eyes. The pretty pupils are always under a recursive expansion and contraction which is extremely harmful. 

Generally, to circumvent the above problem, developers sometimes reduce the brightness so low, which is perfect for the browser, but the code editor becomes so faint that the pretty pupils have to expand so big that it hurts. 

Bake My Eye is a simple attempt at solving this problem. The application will update screen brightness when you switch from Code Editor to Browser & vice a versa.

Currently, its only a terminal application with hard-coded values for Terminal and Google Chrome for testing purposes. The real desktop app to come soon.
